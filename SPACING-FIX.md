# âœ… Fixed: Spacing in Status Display

## Issue Fixed
The status display in the header was showing:
- `Total checks:74` (missing space after colon)
- `Total ads:74` (missing space after colon)

Instead of the desired:
- `Total checks: 74` (with space after colon)
- `Total ads: 74` (with space after colon)

## Solution Applied
Updated `frontend/src/components/AppHeader.vue` to add spaces after colons:

**Before:**
```vue
<span>Total checks:</span>
<span>Total ads:</span>
```

**After:**
```vue
<span>Total checks: </span>
<span>Total ads: </span>
```

## Result
Now the header stats will display with proper spacing:
- âœ… `Total checks: 74`
- âœ… `Total ads: 74` 
- âœ… `Uptime: 2 hours 15 minutes` (was already correct)

The fix only affects the Vue.js frontend header display. No backend changes were needed since the issue was purely in the frontend formatting.

ðŸŽ‰ **The spacing issue is now resolved!**
